#About the design

This is the homepage of a horse riding club in England that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. We chose a soothing gray for adults and a cheerful yellow for children.

The image of a horse eating carrots and the horse logo represent the friendliness of the horse riding club. We draw attention to the subscription field by the glowing "subscribe" text.
